#Now, imagine that you've been informed that the previous list is not up-to-date and that there is 
#another employee that now has access to the device. You're given the updated list of usernames with 
#access, including the new employee, as follows: "madebowa", "jnguyen", "tbecker", "nhersh", 
#"redwards", and "lpope".In this task, reassign the variable username_list to the new list. Run the 
#code to display the list before and after it's been updated to observe the difference.

username_list = ["madebowa", "jnguyen", "tbecker", "nhersh", "redwards"]
print(username_list)

username_list = ["madebowa", "jnguyen", "tbecker", "nhersh", "redwards", "lpope"]
print(username_list)
