#Finally, you can also assign a Boolean value of `True` or `False` to a variable.In this task, you'll 
#create a variable called `login_status`, which is a Boolean that represents whether a user is logged 
#in. Assign `False` to this variable and store its data type in a variable called `login_status_type` 
#and display it.

login_status = False
login_status_type = type(login_status)
print(login_status_type)
# Output: <class 'bool'>
