#This code continues to check for the Boolean value of whether max_logins is less than or equal to 
#login_attempts. In this task, reassign other values to login_attempts. For example, you might 
#choose a value that is higher than the maximum number of attempts allowed. Observe how the output changes.

max_logins = 3
login_attempts = 5
print(login_attempts <= max_logins)
# Output: False
