#You are asked to help automate the process of checking whether a user's operating system requires 
#an update. Imagine that a user's device can be running one of the following operating systems: OS 1, 
#OS 2, or OS 3. While OS 2 is up-to-date, OS 1 and OS 3 are not. Your task is to check whether the user's 
#system is up-to-date, and if it is, display a message accordingly. To do this, complete the conditional 
#statement using the keyword if.

system = "OS 2"

if system == "OS 2":
    print("no update needed")
