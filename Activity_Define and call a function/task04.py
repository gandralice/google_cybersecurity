#In the next part of your work, you're going to work with a list of approved usernames, representing 
#users who can enter a system. You'll be developing a function that helps you convert the list of 
#approved usernames into one big string. Structuring this data differently enables you to work with it 
#in different ways. For example, structuring the usernames as a list allows you to easily add or remove 
#a username from it. In contrast, structuring it as a string allows you to easily place its contents into 
#a text file.
